# Mission
> [!NOTE]
> When we refer to "AI" in this project, we do NOT mean machine learning or LLM's. The AI in this project is entirely chained logic & math.

## Why did I make this?
I came up with the idea for this project while riding the GO Train in Toronto. As a frequent user of public transit who hasn't obtained a driver’s license yet--and isn't keen on paying for car insurance--I depend on these systems to get around. More often than not, I find myself frustrated with the current state of public transit. Whether it's delays, overcrowding, or inefficient routes, there are many areas fit for improvement. I started thinking: what if we equipped every single transit vehicle with a tracker, used real-time data to monitor their status, passenger loads, and projected demand, and then used AI to optimize the entire system dynamically?

## What do we hope to achieve?
The mission is to "show, not tell." This refers to our goal of *showing* transit authorities what we want, rather than *explaining* what we want--an approach that typically falls on deaf ears. Meanwhile, our technical goal for this project is to show that "If AI can do it better, so can we." Therefore, this project aims to prove both: the former to the public, and the latter to ourselves.

### As a proof of concept
The primary goal is to serve as a proof of concept, demonstrating that AI and algorithms can solve many of the logistical problems faced by public transit systems today. The hypothesis is that if we can create an AI capable of managing a transit network more efficiently than current standards, we can apply that knowledge to the real world. We can use insights from this simulation to inform the design of actual transit systems, making them more responsive and user-friendly. We want to show executives, planners, and politicians that with the right tools, public transit can be significantly improved without necessarily increasing costs or infrastructure.

### As a statement
Secondly, this project serves as a statement that many public transit issues are caused by self-imposed constraints--such as prioritizing cars, budget limitations, or political negligence--rather than genuine technical or logistical barriers.

Most of my friends drive instead of using public transit. When I ask them why, they often cite reasons like:
- "I like the freedom of driving."
- "I don't want to wait in poor weather for a bus or train."
- "Public transit is unreliable and frequently delayed."
- "Public transit is overcrowded and feels unsafe."
- "The routes don't go where I need to go."

The majority of people, especially in North American suburbs, have never experienced a [genuinely good public transit system](https://youtu.be/aLKN_Rmb39I). They have either only experienced poorly managed networks or have never used public transit at all. This project aims to change that perception by visualizing the transit networks they are used to, but optimized to their full potential using advanced mathematical models.

Why is Tokyo's transit system so much more efficient than New York's? Why is Vancouver's SkyTrain often viewed as more reliable than Toronto's TTC? This project aims to show you, visually and interactively, what is dragging down a public transit system & how it can be fixed. We want to give you the ability to hold your public transit authorities accountable, to walk into city council meetings with more than just your voice.

### As a platform for experimentation
We aim to build a simulator accessible to everyone, from gamers to transit planners, allowing them to experiment with different designs and strategies. By providing a sandbox for exploration, we hope to inspire new approaches to public transit and contribute to the global improvement of these systems.

### As a vision for the future
Between serving as a proof of concept, a tool for shifting public perception, a sandbox for planners, and an entertaining game, this project aims to be a versatile platform. A platform that forces us to rethink our approach to mass transit, and proves that high-quality service is achievable regardless of the circumstances.

## Doesn't stuff like this already exist?
There are indeed existing simulation games for transportation networks, with [3D-Public-Transport-Simulator](https://github.com/alen-smajic/3D-Public-Transport-Simulator) being a close peer. However, this project distinguishes itself in key ways.

Most existing simulators focus on city-building mechanics or general logistics rather than specifically transit optimization. They often compromise on physics, AI complexity, and realism to provide a broader entertainment experience. In contrast, this project is fully focused on public transit systems. We are creating a realistic simulation that captures the nuances and complexities of real-world networks. Despite using 2D graphics for simplicity, we aim to push the boundaries of simulation accuracy.

Furthermore, many city builders, like *Cities: Skylines 2*, are commercial products. Even detailed simulators like [Subway Builder](https://www.subwaybuilder.com) are often paid and closed-source. These titles are less suitable for researchers or planners who need to modify and/or inspect the code to meet their requirements.

By creating a free and open-source project, we democratize access. Transit planners, researchers, and enthusiasts can experiment with designs without licensing fees or restrictions, hopefully fostering innovation in the field.

## Conclusion
We are building a transit simulator that entertains, educates, and inspires. By leveraging AI and advanced simulation techniques, we hope to demonstrate that public transit *can* be excellent, and encourage new thinking in transit planning. We want to send a message to authorities that investing in public transit is not just a social responsibility, but a smart economic decision that yields returns in efficiency, sustainability, and quality of life--even in the suburbs.

Cities like Tokyo, Seoul, and various European capitals have shown that with the right planning and political will, public transit works. We want to prove *why* they're good mathetically, and we want to provide the tools to optimize these systems further.
